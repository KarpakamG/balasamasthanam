    <h2>About the Temple</h2>
    <!-- <p>Sri Bala Temple, established in 1905, stands as a spiritual center for devotees seeking divine blessings, cultural heritage, and community unity.</p> -->
    <p style="text-align:justify;">Sri Math Oushada Lalita Maha Tripura Sundari, a divine marvel unseen anywhere else in this century, is enshrined on the upper sanctum above the Tithi Nithya steps. She appears in her Vishwaroopa (cosmic form) as the Herbal Divine Mother (Mooligai Amman), holding the Angusha (goad), Pasha (noose), and a black bow, blessing all as a divine healer whose entire form is composed of sacred medicine. Facing the sanctum is the VimƒÅna of the main deity, with the consecration (prathishta) of Mahakameshwarar as a Spatika (crystal) Shiva Linga, and the Maha Kumbabhishekam (grand consecration ceremony) was performed in 2016.</p>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
        She who is the child embodiment of all supreme energies, the divine Bala Tripura Sundari, chief among the ninety crore Siddhas, who has manifested in her childhood form. 
        Having repeatedly appeared as a child in the dreams of a devout soul of Mylapore Kapaleeswari (Karpagambal), this led to the founding of the Sripeedam Sri Bala Samasthanam (Vaalaikottam), 
        the Mooligai Lalitha Tripurasundari Temple near OMR, in the village of Thirupporur ‚Äì Sembakkam. 
        It is the first Bala Tripura Sundari temple in Tamil Nadu.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
        The Asadhya Sri Chakra ‚Äì Maha Meru was consecrated in 2010 at the spiritual center of Sembakkam village, 
        aligned with the second enclosure (Aavarana) of Kanchipuram. It stands before the main deity, Balaambika. 
        As described in the 97th verse of the Abirami Anthathi, with Kamakshi Devi and Sri Vidya Gurus spiritually present, 
        the Sri Chakra was installed as a Vidya Guru Mandala. In front of the Mooligai Goddess Lalithambika, 
        a sacred Maha Meru crafted from a single neem tree is enshrined and covered with a silver shield (Vellikkavasam).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">
        She is the child form of all divine powers and the leader of 900 million Siddhas. 
        Born from the life force of Sri Chakra‚Äôs Queen, Lalita Tripura Sundari, she manifested to destroy the 30 sons of Pandasura. 
        Our Sri Peetam is the first sacred shrine in Tamil Nadu where Bala Tripura Sundari is enshrined as the main deity, 
        following the sacred Shilpa Agama and dhyana sloka traditions. 
        She sits on a lotus pedestal, holding a book and prayer beads in her upper hands, and shows the Abhaya and Varada mudras in her lower hands. 
        With braided hair and a radiant childlike face, she blesses devotees with wisdom, marriage harmony, and the joy of children.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">
        Other divine sanctums include the powerful Sri Uchchishta Maha Ganapati, the wish-fulfilling Sri Kamadhenu,  
        and Sri Maha Kameswara Swami worshipped as a Spatika (crystal) Shiva Lingam.  
        Also enshrined in their own sacred shrines are:  
        ‚Äì the protective eight-armed Sri Ashtabuja Maha Jaya Varahi Devi, who holds a staff and guards with divine might  
        ‚Äì the graceful Sri Rajamatangi Devi, also with eight arms, who blesses like a spiritual minister.  
        Alongside them, several Goshta Devatas (guardian deities) reside in beautifully sculpted black-stone forms,  
        each radiating their unique divine presence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">
        The temple‚Äôs Utsava Murthis (processional deities) include:  
        Sri Uchchishta Ganapati, Sri Bala Dhandayudhapani, the sacred Thiruvambala Chakra Peetam,  
        Sri Bala Tripura Sundari, Rama-Vani Lalita Tripura Sundari,  
        Lagu Varahi and Rajamatangi Devis,  
        Sri Maha Kameswarar with Kameswari Devi,  
        Perumal with Thayar (Mahalakshmi),  
        Eight-armed Maha Varahi and Rajamatangi,  
        Unmatta Bhairavar, and Sri Annapoorani Devi‚Äî  
        all enshrined in their own sanctums, radiating divine grace.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">
        The ten Mahavidya Goddesses, divine guardians of all ten directions, are beautifully enshrined here.  
        These include Sri Maha Kali, Sri Tara Devi, Sri Bhuvaneshwari, Sri Tripura Bhairavi,  
        Sri Chinna Mastha, Sri Dhoomavati, Sri Bagalamukhi, and Kamalatmika Devi.  
        Each goddess has her own sanctum, sculpted under the spiritual guidance of Swamiji.  
        In 2024, a grand Kumbabhishekam (consecration ceremony) was performed.  
        This temple is honored as the first Mahavidya Sri Peetam in Tamil Nadu.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">
        Sri Bala Sri Peetam was formed through divine guidance, blessings, and spiritual experiences under the grace of revered saints and sages‚Äî  
        Sage Agathiyar, Goddess Lopamudra Devi, Srimath Chidambara Swamigal,  
        Seshadri Mahaan, Thirumuruga Kirupananda Variyar Swamigal,  
        Polur Vidopa Sivarama Lingam Swamigal, and the great Kanchi Mahaperiyava.  
        Their sacred presence and blessings continue to shine through the foundation of this Peetam.
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-align:center; color:#8b0000;">Nithya Pooja ‚Äì Sacred Daily Worship at Sri Peetam</h2>

      <p style="text-align:justify;">
        At the Sri Peetam in Valaikottam, daily Padha Pooja (sacred foot worship) is offered to Sri Oushadha Lalithambikai Amman.  
        From 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m., Abhishekam (ritual bathing), decoration, and worship are performed for the main deity Sri Bala Tripura Sundari and the Asadhya Sri Chakra.  
        Only after these sacred rituals are completed are devotees allowed for darshan.  
        All poojas are conducted strictly according to the Shaiva Agama and Sri Vidya Tantra traditions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">
        At the upper-level sanctum, where the 16 Nithya Tithi steps are located,  
        Sri Oushadha Lalitha Maha Tripura Sundari is enshrined in a majestic standing posture,  
        crafted entirely from sacred spiritual herbs‚Äîher Viswaroopa Mooligai form.  
        Directly in front of her, Sri Maha Kameswarar appears in the form of a Shiva Lingam,  
        radiating divine grace and presence.
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-align:center; color:#8b0000;">Sri Bala Sri Peetam ‚Äì The Divine History of This Sacred Site</h2>

      <p style="text-align:justify;">
        Revered as ‚ÄúNorth Thiruvanaikka,‚Äù the village of Sembakkam is nestled in a sacred forest surrounded by jamun trees.  
        It is home to 27 Vinayaka shrines worshipped by saints like Sembiyan Sengottu Chozha Nayanar, ash-smeared sages,  
        Siddhas such as Agathiyar and Goddess Lopamudra, Nagas, and Nava Veerars.  
        To the right of the divine Sri Alagambikai Jambukeswarar Temple,  
        beyond the reach of thought and speech, shines the child goddess Sri Bala Tripura Sundari.  
        She resides in the Sri Chakra Raja Sabha at the sacred seat of Srimath Oushadha Lalitha Maha Tripura Sundari Sri Peetam.  
        This divine abode is located on the Thiruporur‚ÄìChengalpattu road in Chengalpattu district.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">
        A unique and divine aspect of this temple is that all the deity idols and temple structures  
        have been personally crafted by Swamiji, who is both a sculptor and an expert in Agama Shastra.  
        He also lovingly performs the daily poojas with deep spiritual devotion.  
        The temple is managed by Sri Peedam Sri Bala Samasthanam and functions under the  
        registered Sri Chakra Raja Poorna Mahameru Trust.
